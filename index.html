The 1Million against Abuse Campaign is committed to extending age-appropriate Personal Safety Education as a preventative measure against Child/Adult Sexual Abuse. We have an online petition on change.org which highlights our efforts to reach out to decision makers including Maneka Gandhi, Sri Narendra Modi, and (refer to petition). The primary ASK (demand) of the petition is to make our Personal Safety Education curriculum a compulsory part of the ISC and CBSE Board. Details and updates relating to the petition can be found here – URL
The 1Million against Abuse campaign is run by a diverse and seasoned team of activists, legal professionals, mental health professionals, and influencers, each of whom brings a valuable skill to the campaign’s exhaustive list of awareness and intervention related activities.

  Our Personal Safety Education curriculums are customized to meet the needs of various age groups, and are further customized in order to build partnerships with ancillary groups whose objectives are similar to ours.
  Sessions can be as basic in content and duration as “Know your Legal Rights”, which will take 45 minutes to an hour; for those who would like an in-depth knowledge of the issue, intervention strategies, and legal options, we conduct 1 to 3 day certificate courses.

<h3 style="font-family: 'Russo One"> How it works</h3>
<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%; font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;
font-size:1.5em">If a school or institute would like us to visit, and conduct an interactive PSE session with their students/members, they are welcome to email us or connect via any of our social media (links here)
  They will then receive a questionnaire which will endeavor to best understand the needs of the school or institute, the age group of its members, special needs and vulnerabilities if any, and any additional outcomes/goals which need addressing through the session. For example, we recently conducted an exciting workshop on Cyber-bullying and Cyber sexual Assault for a group, after one of their members was targeted by a troll.
  Once we receive the questionnaire, we will revert with an action plan, and coordinate!</p>

From identifying common traits present in the average troll, to knowing how to report someone who is bullying you/your child/colleague, this is an extremely important part of the campaign which has so far enabled us to identify a number of individuals and groups who use the internet to bully and assault individual, especially vulnerable children.

From finger puppets to emoticon dolls which will “speak” for you about things you are uncomfortable with talking about, these activities are open to all age groups. We use them as part of both, awareness, as well as therapy and disclosure exercises for survivors.

We include two vastly different kinds of self-defense education as part of the campaign in order to
The first is a ground level, practical set of techniques which anyone can execute. These basic techniques are taught by us, and are easily executed with minimum effort. From tips on staying safe, to handy (legal, non-lethal) objects to carry as makeshift self defense implements, our sessions are fun and interactive, and will elicit both awareness, and laughter!
One of our most recent examples of a practical self-defense session can be found in this 30-minute video (Tanishq showroom session dated March 11th 2017) – URL
The second level of self-defense is for older groups, and will be handled in collaboration with Team Relentless from Mumbai, which, aside from producing most of the top-ranking combat sports fighters in the country, is committed to teaching MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) based self-defense.
